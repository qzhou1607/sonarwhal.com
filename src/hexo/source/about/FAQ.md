# FAQ

## What is sonar?

sonar is a linting tool for the web, with a strong focus on the developer
experience: easy to configure, develop, and well documented.

sonar doesn't want to reinvent the wheel. For that reason it tries to integrate
other tools and services that do a great job and contribute back where
appropriate. For example, we are using [axe](https://www.deque.com/products/axe/)
for accessibility, [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) for
checking the certificate configuration, etc.

## What is sonar's goal?

We have a few:

* Bring the community together to decide what best practices are in several
  areas.
* Help web developers write the best possible code.
* Clean up the web of bad practices.
* Promote community tools and services that do an awesome job but could not be
  known by everybody.

## What can I do to help?

There are lots of things you can do to make sonar better, from reviewing
documentation, writting new one, filling bugs, triaging, coding, etc.

We will gladly accept any contribution you can do. Most of the
[issues in sonar](https://github.com/sonarwhal/sonar/issues) should have a
difficulty level. Also don't hesitate to ask for help.

## What browsers are supported?

sonar currently supports [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), Chrome, and Edge 15.
We hope to add support for Firefox soon. If your favorite browser is not
supported you can always
[develop a collector](/docs/developer-guide/collectors/index.md) for it!

## Is there a plugin for my favorite editor?

Editor plugins are not yet available, but it is high in our priority list.

## Is there an online service?

Currently there isn't an online service, but having one is part of our
priorities for the v1.

## What is the logo?

Our logo is Nellie the narwhal. Narwhals are not only [awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwqXuMPsoc)
but have one of the best sonars in the animal kingdom:

[Narwhal echolocation beams may be the most directional of any species](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161110154942.htm)

> [â€¦] some of the first recordings of wintering narwhals showed that they may have the most directional sonar of any species.

## I don't agree with one of your rules, how can I tell you?

Great, let's make it better. You can [open an issue here](https://github.com/sonarwhal/sonar/issues/new)
telling what you think can be improved.
